# contracts

## Backend:
- Need to get number of already minted souls, think how to avoid it (in mint(...) function)

## Logic:
- Who can actually mint SBT, and how to track it?
- Multiply operators to mint should be companies, minting SBT_achievements.
- Souls can mint only this contract, so here everything is OK

## Smth
- There are no typedefs in Solidity
